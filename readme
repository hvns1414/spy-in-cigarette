Project Overview

Spy in Cigarette is a Python script that provides two main functionalities:

Network Scanning: It scans a given IP range in the network and lists the devices' IP and MAC addresses.

MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) Attack: It performs ARP spoofing to intercept and modify traffic between a target and a gateway.

Additionally, it provides a loading screen that enhances the user experience by showing an animation during long-running operations.

Requirements

To run this project, you need the following requirements:

Python 3.6 or higher

Pip (Python package manager)

scapy library (for network manipulation)

Installation
Linux/macOS

Navigate to the project directory.

Open the terminal and run the following command:

bash install.sh


This will install all the necessary dependencies and set up the environment for you.

Windows

Navigate to the project directory.

Open Command Prompt and run the following command:

install.bat


This will install the required dependencies and prepare the script for execution in a Windows environment.

Usage
Network Scanning

To scan the devices on your network and list their IP and MAC addresses, use the following command:

python spy_in_cigarette.py -l

MITM Attack

To start a Man-in-the-Middle attack, use the following command, specifying the target IP and the gateway IP:

python spy_in_cigarette.py -t [Target IP] -g [Gateway IP]


For example:

python spy_in_cigarette.py -t 192.168.1.10 -g 192.168.1.1


This will perform the MITM attack between the target device with IP 192.168.1.10 and the gateway with IP 192.168.1.1.

Code Explanation
scan_network(network)

Scans the network for devices in the given IP range and lists their IP and MAC addresses.

arp_spoof(target_ip, target_mac, gateway_ip, gateway_mac)

Performs ARP spoofing by poisoning the ARP cache of the target and gateway devices. This redirects traffic through the attacker’s machine.

mitm_attack(target_ip, gateway_ip)

Starts the MITM attack by continuously performing ARP spoofing to intercept traffic between the target device and the gateway.

loading_screen(duration)

Displays a loading animation in the terminal to give the user visual feedback during long-running operations. It shows a spinning wheel (|, /, -, ) to indicate progress.

Caution

This script is intended for educational purposes only and should be used in legally authorized networks.

MITM attacks and ARP spoofing techniques should only be used for network security testing and on networks you own or have explicit permission to test. Using them without permission is illegal in most jurisdictions.

Please act responsibly and always follow ethical hacking principles.

Project Overview

Spy in Cigarette is a Python-based network monitoring and attack tool. It provides two main functionalities:

Network Scanning: Scans a specified IP range and lists all connected devices with their IP and MAC addresses.

MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) Attack: Performs ARP spoofing to intercept and potentially manipulate the traffic between a target device and the network gateway.

Additionally, Spy in Cigarette includes a loading screen feature, offering a user-friendly experience during long-running operations by displaying a real-time loading animation.

Features

Scan and list all devices connected to your network, showing their IP and MAC addresses.

Perform MITM attacks using ARP spoofing to intercept traffic between a target and the gateway.

Display a professional loading screen to keep users informed during lengthy operations.

Requirements

Before using this script, ensure that you have the following:

Python 3.6 or higher

pip (Python package manager)

scapy library (for network manipulation)

To install the necessary dependencies, run the installation script, as described below.

Installation
Linux/macOS

Clone the repository or download the project files.

Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

Run the following command to install the dependencies and set up the environment:

bash install.sh


This will install all required Python libraries listed in requirements.txt.

Windows

Clone the repository or download the project files.

Open Command Prompt and navigate to the project directory.

Run the installation script:

install.bat


This script will set up the required dependencies for Windows environments.

Usage
Network Scanning

To scan your network for connected devices and list their IP and MAC addresses, use the following command:

python spy_in_cigarette.py -l

MITM Attack

To perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack, provide the target device's IP and the gateway's IP:

python spy_in_cigarette.py -t [Target IP] -g [Gateway IP]


For example:

python spy_in_cigarette.py -t 192.168.1.10 -g 192.168.1.1


This command will perform the MITM attack between the target device with IP 192.168.1.10 and the gateway with IP 192.168.1.1.

Code Explanation

scan_network(network):

Scans the provided IP range (network) and lists all connected devices with their corresponding IP and MAC addresses.

arp_spoof(target_ip, target_mac, gateway_ip, gateway_mac):

Executes ARP spoofing, poisoning the ARP tables of both the target and the gateway to intercept their communication and direct it through the attacker's machine.

mitm_attack(target_ip, gateway_ip):

Initiates the MITM attack. It continuously performs ARP spoofing to position the attacker in between the target device and the network gateway.

loading_screen(duration):

Displays a loading animation during long-running operations, informing the user that the process is still ongoing.

Caution

This script is intended for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use of this tool may be illegal in many jurisdictions. You should only run it on networks you own or have explicit permission to test.
